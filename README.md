# Logging Vector demo

This code reads demo logs generated by vector.dev and writes it into clickhouse.
The docker-compose would spawn up 2 containers:

1. Vector.dev to produce the demo logs and write to ClickHouse
2. Grafana to visualize the logs

Pre-requisite:
- docker
- double.cloud ClickHouse Cluster

Getting started:
1. Create Table in ClickHouse
2. Edit .env and create the below variables

```
DCUSER=admin
DCPASS=OHJKLB34L5KJVHJ345FK435H23J
DCHOST=rw.qwertyuiop.at.double.cloud
HTTPPORT=8443
NATIVEPORT=9440
DCCONNECT="https://${DCHOST}:${HTTPPORT}"
```
 
 Bring up the containers using docker compose
```
docker compose up
```
And visit http://localhost:3000/dashboards and play around
